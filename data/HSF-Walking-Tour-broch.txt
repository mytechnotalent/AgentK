The  Wharf 

When  the  Virginia 
Central  Railroad  was 
built  in  1854,  it 

changed  Staunton 

from  a  rural  village 

into  a  booming  center  of  commerce.  By  the  turn 

of  the  century,  warehouses  were  built  around  the 

train  depot  suppling  everything  from  fresh  pro- 

duce  to  wagons  and  harnesses.  The  Wharf  Area 
Historic  District  was  listed  in  the  National 
Register  of  Historic  Places  in  1972. 

Augusta  Co.  Courthouse »  1901  @ 
Located  on  the  corner  of 
Johnson  and  Augusta  Streets, 
this  T.J.  Collins  designed  building 
is  the  fifth  to  occupy  this  site.  In 
1745,  a  crude  log  stucture  built 
here  served  as  the  first  county 
courthouse. 

120-124  S.  Augusta  St.  »  1876 
This  building’s  upper  facade  is 
made  of  pressed  metal,  a  rarity  in 
Staunton,  a  town  better  known 
for  brick  buildings.  The  structure 
was  built  directly  over  Lewis  Creek, 
which  still  flows  underneath. 

119-123  S.  Augusta  St.  *  ca.  1880 
The  pride  Victorian  builders  took 
even  in  utilitarian  structures  is  evi- 
dent  in  this  warehouse.  Originally 
the  wholesale  grocery  house  of 
Hoge  &  Hutchinson,  it  was  com- 
pletely  renovated  in  1982. 

125  S.  Augusta  St.  »  1855 
When  buit  by  the  railroad  inthe 
18505,  The  American  Hotel  was  the  last 
word  n  luxury.  The  Stonewall  Brigade 
Band  serenaded  President  and  Mrs. 
Ulysses  S.  Grant  from  thissite  in  1874 
‘when  their  train  passed  through.

“Breadbasket  of  the  Confederacy.”  While  most  of  the  bat-

Staunton’s 
Architectural  Legacy 
Thomas  Jasper  (“T.1.")  Collins  moved  to 
Staunton  in  1891,  and  during  the  next  twenty 
years  he  designed  or  remodeled  over  200 
buildings  in  the  Staunton  area.  Collins  worked 
within  a  wide  range  of  styles.  His  office  was 
housed  in  the  Romanesque  Revival  Style 
Marquis  building  on  the  SE  comer  of  Beverley 
and  Augusta  Streets.  His  designs  can  be  seen 
in  the  Second  Empire  style  Eakleton  Hotel,  the 
Chateauesque  CW.  Miller  House  on  New 
Street,  the  C&O  Station  and  the  Richardsonian  Romanesque  Arista  Hoge 
House  on  Kalorama  Street.  His  influence  touched  both  commercial  and  resi- 
dential  properties  in  the  Gity,  many  of  which  are  on  the  walking  tour. 
T.J.  Collins  retired  in  1911.  The  legacy of  hiswork,  and  that  of  his  sons  Will  and 
Sam  who  followed  him,  continued  with  T.J.  Collins’  grandson  Joseph  Johnson. 
Their  architectual  designs  left  a  distinct  impression  on  Staunton’s  landscape.
